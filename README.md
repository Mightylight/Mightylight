Hi my name is Bas (A.K.A Mightylight),

I'm an aspiring game developer and currently studying Creative Media and Game Technologies
at Saxion University.

I'm very interested in learning about AI/algorithms, but I'm open to all things programming!

My skills:
- Processing
- C# 
- HTML & CSS
- Unity

Soon you will be able to see what projects I've worked on
In the meantime checkout my LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/basmeddeler/
